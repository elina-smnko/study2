Metric Kit ↑

Memory graph in Xcode
SwiftLint (for example) for basic code quality 
Code repetition (manually or use third-party solutions)
Xcode instruments -> Activity, Energy usage, Leaks
Look manually for strong references
Look for UI warnings in logs (constraints for example)
Pay attention to Xcode warnings
Check test coverage

For multithreading use Xcode sanitizer tools:
Thread Sanitizer—The TSan tool detects race conditions between threads.
Main Thread Checker—This tool verifies that system APIs that must run on the main thread actually do run on that thread.
